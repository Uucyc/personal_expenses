# Personal Expenses Tracker App.

My first Flutter project.

## About

This is a 'learn & build'-approach project as a starting point for my Flutter engineering path.

Cross-platform and adaptive, some features change or appear whether user is on iOS / Android (Cupertino - Material switch) and also due to the screen size & its orientation.

App allows user to track weekly personal expenses in a simple way. User can add & delete transactions for a scpecific date, which are later shown as a scrollable list - but also displayed in a chart (optional in a landscape mode), with 7 previous days filled colorly according to their percentage in relation to the total weekly amount.

When on iOS, Material-style button at the bottom removed & second 'add' button changed to Cupertino style (just as some other buttons & elements - Appbar etc.) to match common styling guidelines.

Key features widgets were separated into .dart files.
